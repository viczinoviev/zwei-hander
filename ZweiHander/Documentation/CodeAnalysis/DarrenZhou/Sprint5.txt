I have gotten a lot better at following code standards, so there wasn't much refactorying needed for this 
sprint and the variables are all set to private as long as it didn't broke anything. There might be better 
ways of implementing some of the codes I wrote, but I have optimized them to the best of my knowledge. I 
believe my implementation of Kirby this sprint used ralatively minimal code for the functions it has.
Also my teammate Stanislaw was already polishing the game code when everyone else was still working on 
sprint 5, since he did a lot of sprint 5 during sprint 4, so there was not much left for me to do in terms of 
code quality.
