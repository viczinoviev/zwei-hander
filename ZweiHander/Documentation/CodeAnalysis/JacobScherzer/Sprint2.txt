AbstractItem's, ItemManager's, and ChangeItemCommand's constructor is 
just for assigning values, so making it a primary constructor made sense.

BoomerangItem's UseDefaultProperties was not being used, so I gave a basic setup of
making properties = []; so properties can easily be added later if desired.

ItemManager GetItem had Life for the created item right after the constructor.
This could apparently be turned into a block where the Life property is directly
referenced. I could not see any issue with this, and would allow for the option
of making Life's set protected, so I agreed to that change.

ChangeItemCommand's properties should never be changed, so they were made readonly.
