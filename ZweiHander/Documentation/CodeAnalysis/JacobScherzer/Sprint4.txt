The code analysis recommended changing certain fields to readonly, and for all 
those fields it made sense; all these fields had values set in the constructor
that were meant to never change afterwards.

The code analysis recommended removing unused parameters for NumberSprites.
The parameter was "centered". This parameter was supposed to be passed to
another function, but I had forgotten to, so I added this rather than
removing the parameter.

There was some new() simplifcations I was able to do, which I agree with since
you can see the type by just hovering over the variable.

It wanted me to remove unused "itemConstructor" from Setup in AbstractItem. I
disagreed with this, as there is a high probability that setup will use itemConstructor
in the future, possible for a singular items or maybe all items. I want the code to be
ready for that possible change.

ItemManager had a new method made by someone else, with a lowercase first letter. I changed
the name of this method to be simpler (and have a capital first letter), and also added
a summary for this method since it had none.
