I had gotten very used to just using the recommended changes as I was coding.
I noticed that this time I got a lot of issues with white space I had not gotten
in the past. I wonder what changed in my coding to cause this, or maybe it is just
an update in the tool itself. There was a lot of times I forgot to use the new()
simplification, or [] for collections. There was a few times of using null operators
I didn't know or forgot that it reminded me of, like ?? and ?., which simplified code.
