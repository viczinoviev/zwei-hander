Removed random unreacheable code.
Made Camera.cs use primary constructor.
CalculateCollisionInfo in CollisionManager.cs made static.
Simplified some collection initializations.
Removed redundant methods from CollisionManager.cs
Made any fields that can be readonly, readonly.
Made PlayerTeleportCommand.cs and SetCameraCommand.cs use primary constructor.

I did not fix the code in DebugRenderer.cs as its just a dev tool class whose quality does not contribute to the whole project.

Used primary constructor in BorderFactory.cs, simplifed initalizations too. Same for Area.cs nad Border.cs (including making fields readonly).
Also Player.cs, Universe.cs, RoomTransition.cs, RoomPortal.cs, Room.cs, PortalManager.cs, BorderFactory.cs

Update method in RoomPortal cannot be static or have the paremeter removed, we might need that later on.

Fixed some namespace locations (were using not their folder)

	I tend to make the same mistakes over and over, such as not using primary constructors, overcomplicated initalizations
	and not making fields readonly. Something to work on.
