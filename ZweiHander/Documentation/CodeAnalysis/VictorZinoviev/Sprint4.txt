Much of the output from the code analysis tool that I got from the classes I worked on were about public fields that are 
not being used and some formatting issues.

I believe that there could be more coupling for my code that can be reduced, getting a lower coupling for each class, so
I am planning on investigating those and refactoring them as needed in the future sprints.
