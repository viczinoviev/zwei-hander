Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
    I think this class is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The 
	responsibilities are clear where the GameWonScreen owns its controller,
	loads its font, and handles drawing the “You Won” screen while delegating 
	input/state logic to GameWonController. Good practices like using readonly
	for _controller, _font, and _graphicsDevice is good practice and makes it 
	clear these dependencies are set at construction time and not changed later.

Specific comments on code quality:
	This is a nice and simple class. It implements the title screen. Any key 
	press will start the game. The class is minimal while also incorporating
	game state, which allows for switching between different states, such as 
	"game over" screen can now restart into "game start". The class is well 
	commented. The logic in ShouldStartGame is easy to follow. It uses 
	GetPressedKeys() to compare against the previous frame, which is a good 
	way to detect transitions.
