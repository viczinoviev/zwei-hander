Specific comments on code quality/design:
    A very nice and simple class. The class uses multiple sprites to display 
    the item and its count. I like how Draw() avoided drawing everything again,
    and only redraws the number part of the display. The readability and maintainability
    are both really good. The only suggestion I have is it would be nice to have some 
    comments for what the class does exactly, but this isn't too big of a deal given how 
    simple and easy to understand the class already is with descriptive variable names.

Specific comments on readability/maintainability:
    A simple but medium sized class. The code is very self explanatory. The readability 
    and maintainability are both extremly good. The only comment being for the entire class 
    is fine, since nothing else really need explaining, although it would be nice to still have
    some. The variable are all set to private like they should be. There really isnt any compliant 
    for the class.
