Specific comments on readability: 

    A very nice way to keep track of rooms for camera class to use and in 
    the future for the map UI. A simple class with detailed comments, 
    very high readability. Room height and length are hard coded in, which
    is totally fine, as the room size will not be changing as its the 
    very outer boundry of game window. As we continue to develop this game,
    this class will most likely be merged with the border classes I wrote 
    for refactoring.

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality: 

    The maintainbility is good. Some of the codes are repeated multiple 
    times, so we can maybe have a helper function for the repeated lines 
    of code. In terms of maintainability, this class should be kept 
    relatively unchanged, as it has most if not all of the encounter types 
    of collision. The comments are very descriptive, very easy to understand
    what each part of the code is doing. This class and _enemy has very tight
    coupling, which is fine as this class is meant solely for _enemy 
    funcionaility.
