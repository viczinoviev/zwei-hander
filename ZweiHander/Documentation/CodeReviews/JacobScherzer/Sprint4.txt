Specific comments on maintainability/code quality:
	The class works as it should, although more as a manager than as a factory, but 
	that is fine. It avoids usage of magic numbers and instead takes in its constants, 
	such as _tileSize, as input. Thia is a very maintainable approach, that will allow 
	for an easier time changing block size if ever desired in the future. The usage of
	an enum for block names means that the class will get longer as more blocks are
	added, but it also makes it easier to work with the different blocks, as a 
	generic Type does not need to be used for lookup, like in the dictionary used to map
	name to BlockType.

Specific comments on readability:
	All the actual code, such as the variables and methods, have informative names
	that greatly helps in understanding their purpose, usage within the class, and
	how others could use them. However, there is a lack of actual comments explaining
	what is going on in the code. This can make understanding some of the longer
	methods, such as LoadArea or ParseRoom, harder to understand how they work.
	Specifically, this could lead to issues with debugging, or others trying to
	understand how to make their own area.csv.
