Specific comments on readability:
	All the variables are named very well, with each having
	their meaning as clear as possible by the name without
	being excessively long. There's also some nice seperation
	of coding chunks. However, the only comments are commented 
	out code, with not even the methods getting a summary. There
	are multiple places which it feels like a quick comment would
	be very helpful to clarify what that chunk is doing, even if
	one can be pretty sure to cast away any doubts. There is a
	single comment outside the method FindClosestEnemy, which
	does exactly this very well.

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality:
	Each stablable item is its own member of the class, which
	is not the best for adding more stackable types as there is
	a lot of repeating, or what is essentially copying and pasting.
	For the lower number of stackles currently in the project, it is
	acceptable though. Effects are handled very well in my opinion,
	with any new type of effect only needing one short line of code at
	the bottom. There is an issue of space if there is too many effects,
	but that could be fixed later on if needed.
