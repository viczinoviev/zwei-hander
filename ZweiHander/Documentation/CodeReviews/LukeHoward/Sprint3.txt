Specific comments on readability: 

    This file is very easy to read. It is not particularly long and had comments throughout the whole thing.
    All cases for collision are described and the fields in the class are explained. Not setup for player collision
    right now, but should be done quickly.

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality: 

    This script is very nice and easy. It is highly maintanable, as most of the responsibility falls on items themselves.
    The actual collision handler does not have much responsibility. Since items can behave in different ways, I think this is a good idea.
    I did something similar with collision boxes, as different enemies are significantly different sizes. Overall, this is very high quality
    And i see no major issues.
