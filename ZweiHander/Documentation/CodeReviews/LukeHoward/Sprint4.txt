Specific comments on readability: 

    This file is a little challenging to read, as it has very few comments. However, a lot of the code is not challenging
    to understand as there are a good few methods that are just one line or are overall not complicated. The set current location
    and load room functions are the two more challenging methods, but with some time its not too hard. Overall, this file could use a
    little bit more commenting, but its not drastically hard to read or anything.

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality: 

    This file is very well made. It seems to be fairly easy to modify and maintain to adjust the needs for the gameover screen. Intially,
    I had implemented a quick gameover and this is far more in depth and complete. It is very nice that it is set up to restart the game on
    a new command other than the reset r we had. I am thinking about changing the music for the gameover screen, and with this implementation
    I think it should be fairly easy to add.
