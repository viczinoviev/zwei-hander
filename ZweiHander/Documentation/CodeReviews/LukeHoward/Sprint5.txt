Specific comments on readability: 

    At the time of this review, there is not really any comments on this file. However, I did not find it too challenging to read as
    methods are straightforward and variables are named well, so I could still follow what the code was doing. Could do with comments at some
    point, but overall readable.

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality: 

    This file is a nice refactoring of my enemy classes, as I had initially had issues with the AbstractEnemy class at the beggining of the course
    and ended up choosing to avoid it. However, this class would certainly make it easier to alter my enemies in the future. It is well done
    and very easy to maintain.
