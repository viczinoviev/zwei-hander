Specific comments on readability: 

    The item collision handler script is extremely readable. The methods are
    short and they efficiently distribute data to their handling scripts. My only
    possible concern is that it might be redistributing too much of its 
    responsibilities to other files, especially Item.cs. I do not think theres
    an effiecient way to fix it, since this script is responsible for so many
    types of items, but maybe at least the calculation of the collision box could
    be done "in-house", using position and size parameters. Lastly, it could use
    a comment on the idea behind "OnCollision" for this particular type of collider.

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality: 

    The script is condensed and with great comments, but it might not be enough for more advanced use-cases.
    Some things that could be used for future is:
    - scaling the camera
    - changing the offset on a target (look-ahead camera for example)
    - smoothing the motion (to fix jitters)
    Otherwise the encapsulation and private setters are great.
    The comments are very complete as well, with the minor exception of describing the purpose of the whole class.
