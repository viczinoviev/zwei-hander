Specific comments on readability: 

    The BladeTrap enemy class has a good foundation but contains several readability 
    issues that make understanding its behavior difficult. The Thrower property uses 
    magic numbers without explanation, which are also not documented. The Face property 
    appears unused. The originalPosition field stores the trap's home position but
    is public, which breaks encapsulation.
    
    My suggestions are:
    - Create an enum for trap states
    - Add comments for the collisions
    - Make originalPosition private
    - Add comments for thrower

Specific comments on maintainability/code quality: 

    The HUD manager properly uses the state machine pattern for animations. The
    animation system with AnimationState enum is well-designed and the constants for positioning are clearly 
    named. On the other hand, the BuildHUD method has hardcoded magic numbers for off-screen positioning and
    the ConfirmInventorySelection method also has a large switch statement that directly couples the HUD
    to player input actions, which makes it harder to modify or extend the inventory system later.
    
    My suggestions are:
    - Store _inventoryHUD as InventoryHUD type instead of interface
    - Consider extracting the animation logic into a separate AnimationController class
    - Move the item-to-action mapping to InventoryHUD or use a dictionary lookup
