Specific comments on code quality/design:

    The EffectManager class uses Dictionary inheritance effectively to provide effect 
    duration tracking. The Update method implements a good system for tracking both effect 
    durations and overtime effects through the Ticker mechanism. However, the Update method 
    modifies the collection while iterating over it by calling Remove(effect), which could 
    cause issues. The Tickers dictionary initialization uses a hardcoded value (0.5) without 
    explanation of what this timing represents. The Ticked collection provides a nice way 
    to communicate which effects activated this frame.
    
    I would suggest:
    - Create a list of effects to remove and remove them after the foreach loop completes
    - Extract the ticker interval (0.5) as a named constant with a descriptive name
    - Add a brief comment explaining what the ticker interval represents
    - Consider initializing Tickers when effects are first added rather than during update

Specific comments on readability/maintainability:

    The HealthDisplay class has a clean, focused implementation with good use of primary 
    constructor syntax and proper null checking. The heart rendering logic correctly handles 
    half-hearts using Math.Ceiling and the HEART_SPACING constant is well-named and clearly 
    documents its purpose. The if-else chain for sprite selection is straightforward and easy 
    to follow. The class properly implements the IHUDComponent interface even though the 
    Update method is currently empty, which maintains consistency with other HUD components.
    
    My suggestions are:
    - Consider extracting sprite selection into a helper method for potential reuse
    - Add a brief comment in the Update method if it's intentionally empty for the interface
    - The current implementation is solid and doesn't require major changes
