Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	It is not very clear what the properties field is used for, adding a short comment in this file would be helpful.
	Although writing something like "item.Life = life == 0 ? -1 : life; " makes the code shorter, it is not very readable.
	Update and Draw methods are straight foward and easy to understand.
	Detailed comments are provided for properties and methods.

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: PlayerHandler.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Stash
Specific comments on code quality:
	The class has high cohesion, as it focuses on managing the current player sprites.
	However, I think that the logic of checking player input should be handled elsewhere.
	There can be a separate class that handles player input and then calls methods in PlayerHandler to update the player state.
	This would make it so that the PlayerHandler do not need a reference to the Player class.
	There are a lot of switch cases, but this can be easily be refactored through modifications in the PlayerSprite class taking in direction as a parameter.
	We have if branching for UpdatePosition based on the current state. This is fine for now since we only have a attacking and moving state.
	However, it might be good to separate the logic when we start adding more states like using items, opening doors, etc.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	If we add an animation for when the player is picking up an item, we would need to add more cases to the switch statements.
	This may clutter the code further, so it would be easier to refactor if logic specific to each state was separated.
