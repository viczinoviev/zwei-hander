Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	Overall, I think that the class is very readable. Although I did not have any information about how the csv files are
	used in the game to create the map, reading the code gave me a good idea of how each of the cell represents a type of 
	a block. There is nothing much to comment on how readable it is, I think that there is not much to fix. I would recommend
	adding a summary comment of the class to explain what the class is doing.

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: ItemManager
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Jacob
Specific comments on code quality:
	I only thing that I am concerned about is the giant switch case statement for setting the default properties of the items.
	It is quite hard to figure out what each item has as its default properties. I believe there is some reason why the properties
	are being handled in the manager class, but my first though would be to define them in each item class and maybe add a method
	to change the properties later on. The items itselves are working fine, I just think that the class need to be taken a look at
	for how maintainable it would be if we were to have a major change in the items.
