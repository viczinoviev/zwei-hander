Jacob: I feel like overall, things started pretty slow, but picked up pace
later on. We made very good progress and coordinated pretty decently I think.
We all had areas that we were essentially "specialized" in and I think that
worked out pretty well overall.

Darren: Dividing the project based on different components definitely helped 
with the team communication and coordination. At first, the team disagreed 
on what each of our method input and output should be, and how the methods 
should be called. But as we finished the framework of the game and gotten 
more used to communicating with everyone, the project went a lot smoother.
