Jacob: I feel like overall, things started pretty slow, but picked up pace
later on. We made very good progress and coordinated pretty decently I think.
We all had areas that we were essentially "specialized" in and I think that
worked out pretty well overall.

Luke: Overall, the sprint went very well. We had trouble making decisions early on but 
it got much easier with time. We got a lot of work done early which was very nice.
Biggest issue was how a lot of sudden requirements seemed to sneak up on us, but we worked it out.

Darren: Dividing the project based on different components definitely helped 
with the team communication and coordination. At first, the team disagreed 
on what each of our method input and output should be, and how the methods 
should be called. But as we finished the framework of the game and gotten 
more used to communicating with everyone, the project went a lot smoother.

Victor: I think that the sprint went decently well. We made great progress after having
our initial group meeting, where we discussed specific tasks for each group member. However,
I would say that the work load distribution was a bit uneven. There were a lot of discussions
about the design decision of the project, which I think was a good thing. We were able to 
consider different perspectives and got us think how different approaches can be beneficial.
Some things that I would like to improve on the next sprint are task distribution and group
communication.
