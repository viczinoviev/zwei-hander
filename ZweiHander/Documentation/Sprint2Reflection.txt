Jacob: I feel like overall, things started pretty slow, but picked up pace
later on. We made very good progress and coordinated pretty decently I think.
We all had areas that we were essentially "specialized" in and I think that
worked out pretty well overall.

Luke: Overall, the sprint went very well. We had trouble making decisions early on but 
it got much easier with time. We got a lot of work done early which was very nice.
Biggest issue was how a lot of sudden requirements seemed to sneak up on us, but we worked it out.
