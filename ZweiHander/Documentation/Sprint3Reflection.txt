Stanislaw:
This sprint I did not have as much work to do as last one. I had to create only one system,
that being the Collisions. I am pretty happy with my implementation, it seems to meet our use
cases and everyone seems to be able to extend it easily for any purpose. I was done ahead of
time too. I had slight concerns that some of our scripts get only half-baked before we move
on onto the next one, saying that we will come back to them later. For now we are managing
to keep the quality of our work pretty high, lessening my worries.
