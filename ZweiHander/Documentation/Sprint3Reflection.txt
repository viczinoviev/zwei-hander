Stanislaw:
This sprint I did not have as much work to do as last one. I had to create only one system,
that being the Collisions. I am pretty happy with my implementation, it seems to meet our use
cases and everyone seems to be able to extend it easily for any purpose. I was done ahead of
time too. I had slight concerns that some of our scripts get only half-baked before we move
on onto the next one, saying that we will come back to them later. For now we are managing
to keep the quality of our work pretty high, lessening my worries.

Luke:
This sprint was a good bit easier than the first. Most of my work was refactoring and making
Enemies cleaner. Some collisions are not complete a bit to close to the deadline for my 
tastes, but overall I think the team has done very well for this sprint.

Jacob:
This sprint felt like a lot less work. I am hoping that is because it was less work overall
and not because I contributed less. I was hoping to get things done sooner, but ended up
getting caught up with other things. There are still some major communication issues, like
what we want from each other and how to use each other's code.
