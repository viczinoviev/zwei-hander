Luke:
This sprint was a little confusing for me, as I didnt fully understand what I had to do for it. However, I took it as
an opportunity to work on refactoring enemies and getting bladetrap functioning, which ended up being a lot of work itself.
I also did some sfx and worked on the music. I think everyone did a good job this sprint at finding something the project needed and 
getting it done. Overall, I am happy with the teams work this sprint.
