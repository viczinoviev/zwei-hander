Luke:
This sprint was a little confusing for me, as I didnt fully understand what I had to do for it. However, I took it as
an opportunity to work on refactoring enemies and getting bladetrap functioning, which ended up being a lot of work itself.
I also did some sfx,worked on the music, and made 4 rooms. I think everyone did a good job this sprint at finding something the project needed and 
getting it done. Overall, I am happy with the teams work this sprint.

This sprint felt strange. I was not quite sure what I was supposed to do for this. I did do a major rework of how items worked based
upon the sprint2 feedback. I also implemeneted some fun items I really liked. The sprint2 feedback said to differentiate items and
projectiles, but I disagree with this. The reasoning was based upon "different properties", but these properties are already
differentitated using actual properties like CanDamageEnemy or CanBePickedUp, as well as through virtual methods. I got to make a
song for this, which was very fun. I am not very good at songwriting, so it has been a while since I have had an excuse to do so.
