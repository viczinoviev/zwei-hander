Luke:
This sprint went pretty smoothly, I just spent a good chunk of time making the horde mode. I enjoyed making it but outside that, I didnt
have much to do, although I did make some changes to enemies like adding a hit cooldown so you couldnt shred enemies in seconds.

Victor:
There were no major issues in this sprint. I first focused on refactoring the HUD so that the overall structure is cleaner and easier to work with.
Then, I worked on implementing new elements in the game such as the player's buffes that were given through the fairies and addition of new keys. 
I had also helped adding visual components of the new elements our team members had added, which led me to learn more about the other classes and
refactor some of the interface methods for better usability. Overall, I think that our group did very well in communicating and each contributing
something new to the game to make it original.
