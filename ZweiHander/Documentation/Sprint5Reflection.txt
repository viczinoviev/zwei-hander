Luke:
This sprint went pretty smoothly, I just spent a good chunk of time making the horde mode. I enjoyed making it but outside that, I didnt
have much to do, although I did make some changes to enemies like adding a hit cooldown so you couldnt shred enemies in seconds.

Victor:
There were no major issues in this sprint. I first focused on refactoring the HUD so that the overall structure is cleaner and easier to work with.
Then, I worked on implementing new elements in the game such as the player's buffes that were given through the fairies and addition of new keys. 
I had also helped adding visual components of the new elements our team members had added, which led me to learn more about the other classes and
refactor some of the interface methods for better usability. Overall, I think that our group did very well in communicating and each contributing
something new to the game to make it original.

Jacob:
I felt very mixed on this sprint. I enjoyed making some of the systems and seeing their results, but trying to coordinate this with
what others were doing felt odd. I never knew when to let others handle their side of things or when it was better for me to just do it
myself. Specifically, with integrating the damage system into everything, how much I should dig into other people's code to add it.
I did what was essentially a full refactoring of enemy to make it work, which I felt very bad about, as that apparently led to some
issues. Overall I feel like everything worked out, and even way better than I had thought/hoped, but I felt very stressed during it.
